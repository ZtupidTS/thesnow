## 64 bit
nvidia-cg-toolkit: replace it with GLSL
ia32-libs: add libportaudio, libglew
ia32-libs: add .so symlink for compilation
ia32-libs-gtk: add libwxbase2.8 and libwxgtk2.8 (warning a architecture dependant include file (in -dev package) is also needed)
ia32-libs-gtk: add .so symlink for compilation


== Multi-Arch support in APT ==
by David Kalnischkies, mentored by Michael Vogt

Hardware like 64bit processors are perfectly able to execute 32bit
opcode but until now this potentiality is disregard as the
infrastructure tools like dpkg and APT are not able to install and/or
solve dependencies across multiple architectures. The project
therefore focuses on enabling APT to work out good solutions in a
MultiArch aware environments without the need of hacky and partly
working biarch packages currently in use.
