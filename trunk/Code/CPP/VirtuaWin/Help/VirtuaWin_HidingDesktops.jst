== &[vs title "Locking or Hiding Desktops"]     

As applications run independently of VirtuaWin, a 'locked desktop' concept is
flawed and cannot be made secure. For example, an unwanted guest could use the
task manager to suspend the VirtuaWin process and then use any window restore
tool (like WinList) to access the hidden windows. From a security perspective,
the only thing a locked desktop achieves is to prove you have something to
hide!
 
A more suitable approach would be 'stealth', what is not seen is unlikely to
be found. A hidden desktop is no more secure than a locked desktop when
someone else knows it exists, so don't tell anyone!

 
VirtuaWin can be configured to support 1 or more hidden desktops by assigning
a desktop access hotkey to a desktop that is outside of the main Desktop
Layout size. For example, if a 2 by 2 layout is used, assigning a hotkey to
desktop 8 will give you direct access to this desktop yet the desktop and its
contents will be hidden in every other aspect.
 
To configure a hidden desktop, use the main VirtuaWin Setup to change your
Desktop Layout so that your required hidden desktop becomes part of the
layout, e.g. to enable desktop 8 change to a 4 by 2 layout. Change to this new
desktop and use Setup to assign a hotkey, make sure the hotkey is not
something you could accidentally type and don't forget it! Last, restore the
desktop layout so that the hidden desktop is outside this range (i.e. back to
a 2 by 2 layout) and check you can still access the hidden desktop using your
assigned hotkey.

 
As a hidden desktop will not appear on any VirtuaWin menu, moving a window to
it must be done by either making the window sticky or by going to the desktop
and using the Window List menu to Assign the window.

Hiding desktops in VirtuaWin is deliberately low profile, the less this
feature is known the more secure it is.
