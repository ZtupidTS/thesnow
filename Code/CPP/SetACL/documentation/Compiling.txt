SetACL was developed with Microsoft Visual C++ 9.

The latest core Platform SDK, which can be downloaded free of charge on Microsoft's site 
(http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdkredist.htm), is needed for compiling SetACL.
Please make sure that the Platform SDK include folders are searched before Visual Studio's, because the
SDK contains updated versions of many header files.

Example:

The file "winspool.h" contained in the Platform SDK defines JOB_ACCESS_READ.
The file "winspool.h" that comes with Visual C++ 6 does not.

To set the correct order of the include and library files in Visual Studio 6 go to:

Extras / Options and go to the tab "directories".  Make sure that the Platform SDK folders are on top of 
the list for header and library files.
