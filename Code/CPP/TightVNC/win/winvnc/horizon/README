This directory contains some HorizonWimba specific modifications to
the TightVnc winvnc source. It also includes workspace and project
files for our build environment. 

For cursor shape updates, WINVER needs to be set to 0x0500 or greater. 
This is already set in the AppShare.dsp file, but may require a new
sdk to be downloaded from MS. On my Windows 98 box, I've found that
to compile the rc file, I need to use the version of rc.exe that's 
installed by default. Then to compile the rest of the source files, 
I need to register the new sdk environment variables. Because Windows
is awesome, registering and unregistering the new sdk environment
variables should not be done while Visual C is running. Close it, (un)
register variables, then reopen.


General Issues
--------------

The path to the "Executable for Debug Session" will need to be updated
when trying to debug. Also should probably change the working
directory. 

Refer to the README in the subdirectory lib for building supporting
libraries. 

Environment Variables for Build
-------------------------------

APPSHARE_OUT: Location to place the built AppShare. Needs to end with
a slash since the project file doesn't include one (in order to
prevent MSVC from creating the literal directory $(APPSHARE_OUT)).
