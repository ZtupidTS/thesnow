// wxThread has one flaw: On joinable threads, wxThread::Wait does not really
// wait. Instead it continues to dispatch messages from the message queue
// This confuses the program logic.
// wxThreadEx is a simple wrapper class that emulates joinable threads using
// detached threads.
// Wait is emulated by waiting for the variable m_finished to be set to true
// which is done as last operation by the detached thread.

// Implementation is fully transparent: All the user has to do is to replace
// wxThread with wxThreadEx.

// TODO: Implement missing functions as provided by wxThread should they ever 
//       be needed
