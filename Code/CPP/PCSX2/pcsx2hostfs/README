PS2Link is a 'bootloader' which, used together with an Ethernet driver and
a TCP/IP stack, enables you to download and execute software on your PS2.

It is designed to run from memory card, cdrom or host drives.

It loads all IRX's at startup and IPCONFIG.DAT for the network settings.
The IRX's and the IPCONFIG.DAT should be in the directory which PS2LINK is loaded from.

PS2Link requires the following IRX modules:
PS2LINK.IRX               from: ps2link
PS2DEV9.IRX                     ps2sdk
PS2IP.IRX                       ps2sdk
IOPTRAP.IRX                     ps2sdk
POWEROFF.IRX                    ps2sdk
PS2SMAP.IRX                     ps2eth

Building ps2link requires two projects PS2SDK and PS2ETH.

For building against ps2sdk make sure PS2SDK is set to your ps2sdk release
dir. If you do not have ps2sdk built, check it out from cvs and set PS2SDK and
PS2SDKSRC = checked out ps2sdk dir, do 'make' and 'make release'.

NOTES + WARNINGS:
ALL IRX FILENAMES SHOULD BE UPPERCASE.
IPCONFIG.DAT FILENAME SHOULD BE UPPERCASE.

IPCONFIG.DAT uses the following format:
PS2IPADDRESS NETMASK GATEWAYIP
seperated by a single space.

You can load addition IRX's by specifying EXTRACNF file in IPCONFIG.DAT. It
will load the EXTRACNF file and and load all irx's terminated with ';' in the order
they are listed in the EXTRACNF file. By default the EXTRACNF setting is
disabled (commented) with '#' in IPCONFIG.DAT, remove the '#' the load the 
EXTRACNF file.
