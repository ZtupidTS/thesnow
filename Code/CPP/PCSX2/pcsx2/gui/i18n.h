//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Translation Feature: pxE is used as a method of dereferencing very long english text
// descriptions via a "key" identifier.  In this way, the english text can be revised without
// it breaking existing translation bindings.  Make sure to add pxE to your PO catalog's
// source code identifiers, and then reference the source code to see what the current
// english version is.
//
// Valid prefix types:
//
// .Panel:   Key-based translation of a panel or dialog text; usually either a header or
//           checkbox description, by may also include some controls with long labels.
//           These have the highest translation priority.
//
// .Popup:   Key-based translation of a popup dialog box; either a notice, confirmation,
//           or error.  These typically have very high translation priority (roughly equal
//           or slightly less than pxE_Panel).
//
// .Error    Key-based translation of error messages, typically used when throwing exceptions
//           that have end-user errors.  These are normally (but not always) displayed as popups
//           to the user.  Translation priority is medium.
//
// .Wizard   Key-based translation of a heading, checkbox item, description, or other text
//           associated with the First-time wizard.  Translation of these items is considered
//           lower-priority to most other messages; but equal or higher priority to tooltips.
//
// .Tooltip: Key-based translation of a tooltip for a control on a dialog/panel.  Translation
//           of these items is typically considered "lowest priority" as they usually provide
//           the most tertiary of info to the user.
