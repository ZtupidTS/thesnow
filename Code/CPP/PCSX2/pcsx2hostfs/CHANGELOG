------------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-02-18 Version 1.46
	- Added Cached Config support
	- Extra config disabled, at least while cached config is enabled
	- Some code cleanup and reordering
	- More consistant environment (no longer has sio2man and mcman
	  loaded when booting from MC, assuming cached_cfg enabled)
	- Boots from essentially anywhere now
	- Some code uglyfications
	- Elf in bin/ is now packed using ps2-packer
	- Lots of version bumping from beta test versions
	- Other stuff

2006-01-25 Version 1.32
	- Cleaned up and repaired Makefiles
	- Disabled 'check' dependency of make dist as it seems to 
	  be broken, dist was broken anyways so it doesn't seem like 
	  check is being used
	- Builtin_irx made default out of svn
	- Bumped version for tag
	
2004-09-25 Version 1.30
        - Added IOP exception handling
	- Changed IPCONFIG.DAT & EXTRA.CNF a little and added better
	  parsing code.

2004-05-24 Version 1.24
	- Made changes for compiling with ps2sdk, introduction of imports.lst/.h
		and many changes in IOP part to use ioman.h.
	- Set default values for irx_mod pointers and sizes for cached modules
		to ensure they were in .bss and not trashed on pko_reset.
	- Set default values for ip parameters for the same reason as above.
    - New command writemem
    - Can load irx files from a defined file in IPCONFIG.DAT
    - All-In-One elf (irx's embedded in the elf) build target.

    - Some new commands stop/start vu, dump mem, dump reg, gsexec

2004-02-06 Version 1.22
      - HOST: getdir support (so ps2 can get filelist from host:, using ioman calls)

2004-01-29 Version 1.21
	- Fixed Host loading (both IRX and ipconfig) - prob with reset (CLEARSPU), but runs fine.
	- Added sbv for prefix checking, to remove LMB for mc load.
	- Added screen/console exception dump selection.
	- Consistent IOP reset for both HOST and other FS load methods.
	- Removed DMS specific loading, module loading made more general.
	- Handles being run from ANY mc dir now.
