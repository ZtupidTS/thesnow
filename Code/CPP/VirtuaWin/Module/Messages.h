 * This is a definition of all possible messages to send to VirtuaWin 
 * and the messages that VirtuaWin uses for module communication
 *
 * All messages starting with VW_ is for controlling VirtuaWin 
 * and messages starting with MOD_ is messages sent by VirtuaWin 
 * 
 * For example if you want to step one desktop to the left:
 * PostMessage(VirtuaWin HWND, VW_CHANGEDESK, VW_STEPLEFT, 0);
 * For messages where you expect a return value, use the SendMessage
 * function instead, see some win32 documentation for more info.
 * 
 * Note: the message numbers is not all in sequence!
