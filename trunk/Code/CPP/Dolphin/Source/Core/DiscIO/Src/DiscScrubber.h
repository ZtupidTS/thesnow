// DiscScrubber removes the garbage data from discs (currently wii only) which
// is on the disc due to encryption

// It could be adapted to gc discs, but the gain is most likely negligible,
// and having 1:1 backups of discs is always nice when they are reasonably sized

// Note: the technique is inspired by Wiiscrubber, but much simpler - intentionally :)
