With the exception of **userpath.cfg** all configuration files are located in the
user’s '@@Application Data/VirtuaWin@@' directory, use the Setup Expert **//Explore
Config//** button to locate this directory. When a user runs VirtuaWin for the
first time all configuration files located in the VirtuaWin installation
directory are copied into the user’s own VirtuaWin directory within their
Application Data area. The following configuration files are used by
VirtuaWin:

=== userpath.cfg

If present in the installation directory it contains a single line defining
the directory containing the user’s configuration files. This file can be used
to solve problems caused by user permissions and roaming profiles. The string
within the file can user environment variables by using the format
'@@${<variable-name>}@@' (e.g. @@${HOMEPATH}@@) and can use the built in variable
@@${VIRTUAWIN_PATH}@@ to use the VirtuaWin installation directory. For example,
the following could be used if a fixed path with the same setup for all users
was required:

    @@c:\VirtuaWin_config\ @@

The following uses a fixed path but allows different configurations per user:

    @@c:\VirtuaWin_conf\${USERNAME}@@

Note that VirtuaWin will create the directory if it does not already exist.

=== virtuawin.cfg

Main user configuration file, the Setup Dialog settings are stored in this file.

=== window.cfg

Configuration file used to store the specific Window Rule setup.

=== module.cfg

Contains the list of currently disabled modules.
