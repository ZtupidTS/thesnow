<h2 class="help_head2">1. About</h2>
<div class="help_section">
	FastCopy is <strong>the Fastest Copy/Delete Software on Windows</strong>.
	<br><br>
	It supports UNICODE and over MAX_PATH (260 byte) file pathnames.
	<br><br>
	<a name="disk_mode"/>
	It automatically selects different methods according to whether Source and DestDir are in the same or different HDD.
	<table class="help_table" border="4">
		<tr><td nowrap><strong>Diff HDD</strong></td><td>Reading and writing are processed respectively in parallel by separate threads.</td></tr>
		<tr><td nowrap><strong>Same HDD</strong></td><td>Reading is processed until the big buffer fills. When the big buffer filled, writing is started and processed in bulk.
</td></tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	Because Reading/Writing are processed with no OS cache at all, other applications don’t easily become slow.
	<br><br>
	It can achieve Reading/Writing performance that is close to device limit.
	<br><br>
	Include/Exclude Filter (UNIX Wildcard style) can be specified.
	<br><br>
	It runs fast and does not hog resources, because MFC is not used. (Designed using Win32 API and C Runtime only) 
	<br><br>
	You can modify this software, because all source code has been opened to the public in the BSD license.
