// Oh the fruits and joys of multithreaded C++ coding conundrums!  This class provides a way
// to be deleted from arbitraty threads, or to delete themselves (which is considered unsafe
// in C++, though it does typically work).  It also gives objects a second recourse for
// doing fully virtualized cleanup, something C++ also makes impossible because of how it
// implements it's destructor hierarchy.
//
// To utilize virtual destruction, override DoDeletion() and be sure to invoke the base class
// implementation of DoDeletion().
//
// Assertions:
//   This class generates an assertion of the destructor is called from anything other than
//   the main/gui thread.
//
// Rationale:
//   wxWidgets provides a pending deletion feature, but it's specific to wxCore (not wxBase)
//   which means it requires wxApp and all that, which is bad for plugins and the possibility
//   of linking PCSX2 core against a non-WX gui in the future.  It's also not thread safe
//   (sigh).  And, finally, it requires quite a bit of red tape to implement wxObjects because
//   of the wx-custom runtime type information.  So I made my own.
