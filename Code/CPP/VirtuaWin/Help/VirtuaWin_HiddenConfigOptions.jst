=== &[a HCO_Edit]Editing a Hidden Option

To change the value of a hidden configuration option you need to manually edit
the &[l VirtuaWin_ConfigurationFiles.htm#CF_VWCFG]@@virtuawin.cfg@@&[/l] file.
To do this: 

1.  Ensures your @@virtuawin.cfg@@ is the latest version as earlier versions may
    not have the option you are trying to set. To do this:

    a.  Open the VirtuaWin &[l VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm]Setup Dialog&[/l].
    
    b.  Make any change so that the **Apply** button becomes active and press
        it.
    
    c.  Undo your change and press the **Apply** button again.
    
2.  In the Setup Dialog got to the Expert tab and click on **Explore Config**,
    then click on **Ok** to close the setup dialog. 

3.  Exit VirtuaWin.

4.  In the Explorer window opened in step 2 locate the @@virtuawin.cfg@@ file and
    open this in a text editor (such as notepad).

5.  Locate the line which starts '@@<option-name># @@', this will typically be
    near the bottom of the file. If the option cannot be found you most likely
    using an earlier version of VirtuaWin.

6.  Change the text to the right of the '@@<option-name># @@' marker to your
    required new value and save the file. 

7.  Restart VirtuaWin, your change should now take effect.
