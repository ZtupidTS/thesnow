These are the command/reply IDs used by FZS:

0: sent to the interface after successful authentication
1: Status messages the interface should display
2: to the server: change server status to the provided value. To interface: status has changed to the given value
3: To interface: User information: New user connected/logged in/disconnected. To server: kick user, retrieve complete user list
4: unused
5: Settings
6: Get/Set user/group data
7: unused
8: Keep-alive

The current admin interface use the m_nEdit variable to manage setting/account editing so that setting/account data isn't requested/edited multiple times at once

bit 0: requested users
bit 1: requested groups
bit 2: requested settings
bit 3: editing settings
bit 4: got all data, prepare editing
bit 8: currently editing

Actually user and group data isn't separated, so this is for the interface only.
Retrieving data and actual editing are handled in two different messages, else admin connection could get out of sync if the dialogs are displayed immediately after receiving data.
