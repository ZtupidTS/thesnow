=== &[a WL_SWL]Standard Window List

The Standard Window List can be opened by:

*.  Clicking the left mouse button on the system tray icon if Setup option &[l
    VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm#SD_MOCWL]Mouse opens compact window list&[/l] is
    disabled,  or by  clicking  the left mouse  button on the system tray icon
    with the Shift key pressed if this option is enabled.

.   Clicking the middle mouse button on the desktop if Setup option &[l
    VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm#SD_EMBWLA]Enable middle button window list activation&[/l] is
    enabled, the Shift key must be pressed if &[l
    VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm#SD_MOCWL]Mouse opens compact window list&[/l] is
    enabled.

.   Binding the **//UI: Open standard window list//** command to a Hotkey and pressing
    this Hotkey.

The standard window list can be configured using Setup's &[l
VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm#SD_AWLA]Available window list actions&[/l] to
display the following columns:

*.  **//Switch To//**: VirtuaWin will change the current focus to the window
selected form this column, if the window belongs to a different desktop to the
current VirtuaWin will also change desktops.
 
*.  **//Move Here//**: A window selected from this column will be moved to the
current desktop and given the focus; only windows not on the current desktop
will be listed in this column.

*.  **//Show//**: A window selected from this column will be shown on the
current desktop, but it is not moved; this means the window can be &[l
VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm#SD_WIN_DW]dismissed&[/l] back to its original desktop.

*.  **//Always Show//**: Toggles whether a window is shown on all desktops,
the windows icon is replaced with a tick icon if the window is currently shown
on all desktops.
 
Only the columns enabled in the **//Available window list actions//** are
initially displayed, however all columns will be displayed if a column title
is clicked on.

**Note:** This window list form is restricted to a maximum of one screen depth
of windows, if more windows exist than can be displayed VirtuaWin will
automatically use a compact window list.   

=== &[a WL_CWL]Compact Window List

The Compact Window List can be opened by:

*.  Clicking the left mouse button on the system tray icon if Setup option &[l
    VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm#SD_MOCWL]Mouse opens compact window list&[/l] is
    enabled,  or by  clicking  the left mouse  button on the system tray icon
    with the Shift key pressed if this option is disabled.

.   Clicking the middle mouse button on the desktop if Setup option &[l
    VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm#SD_EMBWLA]Enable middle button window list activation&[/l] is
    enabled, the Shift key must be pressed if &[l
    VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm#SD_MOCWL]Mouse opens compact window list&[/l] is
    disabled.

.   Binding the **//UI: Open compact window list//** command to a Hotkey and pressing
    this Hotkey.

As with the **//Standard Window List//** form the compact window list can be
used to display 4 different columns. The compact form only displays one column
at a time, click on the title to change to the next column (or the hotkey
'n'). The compact window list will first cycle through the columns enabled in Setup's &[l
VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm#SD_AWLA]Available window list actions&[/l] and then
cycle through all columns.

Unlike the standard window list, the compact window list can display more than
one screen depth of windows and displays more of each window's title bar text.

=== &[a WL_MRUWL]MRU Window List

The Most Recently Used (MRU) Window List can be opened by:

*.  Clicking  the left mouse  button on the system  tray icon with the Control
    key pressed.

.   Clicking the middle mouse button on the desktop with the Control key
    pressed if Setup option &[l VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm#SD_EMBWLA]Enable
    middle button window list activation&[/l] is enabled.

.   Binding the **//UI: Open most recently used window list//** command to a Hotkey and pressing
    this Hotkey.

The MRU window list displays a single list of windows, order by how recently
they they last had the input focused (i.e. similar to the main Windows Alt+tab
window list). VirtuaWin will change the current focus to the window selected
from this list, VirtuaWin will also change desktops if the window belongs to a
different desktop to the current.
