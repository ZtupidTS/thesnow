The Window Menu can be opened by:

*.  Clicking the middle mouse button on the window title bar, see &[l
    VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm]Setup Dialog&[/l]'s Enable middle button window
    menu activation setting.

    this Hotkey while a window has input focus.

.   Binding the **//UI: Open compact window menu//** command to a Hotkey and pressing
    this Hotkey while a window has input focus.

The window menu is used to control and configure the current window, i.e the
window currently with the input focus. The menu contains the following items:


*.  **//Dismiss Window//**: If the current window is only being temporarily show (for
    example the window list 'Show' feature was used to display it, also see
    option On hidden window activation) it will be moved back to its original
    desktop, otherwise the window will be minimized.

.   **//Push to Bottom//**: Pushes the window to the back of the desktop, i.e. under
    every other window.

.   **//Always on Top//**: Toggles the Window ‘Always on top’ property which keeps the
    window above other windows. 


.   **//Manage Window//**: Forces VirtuaWin to manage the current window, this item is
    only available if the window is not currently being managed.

.   **//Stop Managing//**: Forces VirtuaWin to not manage the current window, this
    item is only available if the window is currently being managed.

.   **//Always Show//**: Toggles whether the current window is visible on all desktops
    or just the current one. 

.   **//Gather//**: moves all the windows created by the current window's process onto
    the current desktop.


.   **//Move to Next//**: Moves the current window to next desktop; this command will
    fail if the current desktop is the last desktop and Enable desktop
    wrapping is disabled.

.   **//Move to Previous//**: Moves the current window to next desktop; this command
    will fail if the current desktop is the first desktop and Enable desktop
    wrapping is disabled.

.   **//Move to Desk #//**: Moves the current window to the selected desktop; the
    compact form of the window menu puts these items into a sub menu.

    to the current window selected, this item is only available if the current
    window had a rule applied to it.

    identification section filled with the current window’s details (i.e.
    class name etc.), normal only one name is required for identifying the
    window type so the others should be removed.

    **Note:** The new rule will not be created until you Add the rule. 


.   **//Info//**: Opens a dialog giving detailed information about the current window.

    **Note:** The text in this dialog can be copied using standard Windows Control+C key.
